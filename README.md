 # Horiseon - Setting up Accessibility for Marketing Website 
 
 ## As a marketing agency I have developed the website accordingly following the WCAG standards of web content and accesability guidelines. 

  The following changes made to the website are: 

- Fixing the broken link in the navigation column of the source code. 
- Consolidating the CSS selectors and the properties to follow the sequential order in CSS style sheet.
- Commmented with relavent headlines on CSS style sheet.
- Fixed the contrast settings according to WCAG standards in the side section.
- Fixed the styling for the side section to align it in a order.
